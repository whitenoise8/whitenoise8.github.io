Our approach does not rely on a conventional structural VAR representation of the parameter space for posterior inference. Instead, we elicit hierarchical shrinkage priors directly on the matrix of regression coefficients so that (1) the prior structure directly maps into posterior inference on the reduced-form transition matrix, and (2) posterior estimates are more robust to variables permutation. An extensive simulation study provides evidence that our approach compares favourably against existing linear and non-linear Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes methods. We investigate both the statistical and economic value of the forecasts from our variational inference approach within the context of a mean-variance investor allocating her wealth in a large set of different industry portfolios. The results show that more accurate estimates translate into substantial statistical and economic out-of-sample gains. The results hold across different hierarchical shrinkage priors and model dimensions.","tags":null,"title":"Variational inference for large Bayesian vector autoregressions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Bianco","Lorenzo Cappello"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"e064365a23b4945bd4898d6771801a63","permalink":"https://whitenoise8.github.io/working/change-point-computationally-efficient/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working/change-point-computationally-efficient/","section":"working","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Computationally efficient segmentation for complex time series","type":"working"},{"authors":["Mauro Bernardi","Daniele Bianchi","Nicolas Bianco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"0ea2d5961d7c7c6fca057d639b59dd24","permalink":"https://whitenoise8.github.io/publication/dynamic-variable-selection-in-high-dimensional-predictive-regressions/","publishdate":"2023-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dynamic-variable-selection-in-high-dimensional-predictive-regressions/","section":"publication","summary":"We develop methodology and theory for a general Bayesian approach towards dynamic variable selection in high dimensional regression models with time varying parameters. Specifically, we propose a variational inference scheme which features dynamic sparsity inducing properties so that different subsets of \"active\" predictors can be identified over different time periods. We compare our modeling framework against established static and dynamic variable selection methods both in simulation and within the context of two common problems in macroeconomics and finance, such as inflation forecasting and equity returns predictability. The results show that our approach helps to tease out more accurately the dynamic impact of different predictors over time. This translates into significant gains in terms of out of sample point and density forecasting accuracy. We believe our results highlight the importance of taking a dynamic approach towards variable selection for economic modeling and forecasting.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic variable selection in high-dimensional predictive regressions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Piergiacomo Carlesi","Nicolas Bianco","Cristian Castiglione","Mauro Bernardi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701388800,"objectID":"6347958729d4050bc78f21afe43c68bc","permalink":"https://whitenoise8.github.io/working/dynamic-quantile-graphical-modeling/","publishdate":"2023-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working/dynamic-quantile-graphical-modeling/","section":"working","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic quantiles graphical models","type":"working"},{"authors":["Nicolas Bianco","Cristian Castiglione"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"72a9327cbc32383673298960369cfc66","permalink":"https://whitenoise8.github.io/working/improving-semiparametric/","publishdate":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/working/improving-semiparametric/","section":"working","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Improving Bayesian semi-parametric regression via increasing shrinkage priors","type":"working"},{"authors":["Mauro Bernardi","Daniele Bianchi","Nicolas Bianco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"5ad609de8c9094620289dafa1c40dca2","permalink":"https://whitenoise8.github.io/publication/smoothing-volatility-targeting/","publishdate":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/smoothing-volatility-targeting/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose an alternative approach towards cost mitigation in volatility-managed portfolios based on smoothing the predictive density of an otherwise standard stochastic volatility model. Specifically, we develop a novel variational Bayes estimation method that flexibly encompasses different smoothness assumptions irrespective of the persistence of the underlying latent state. Using a large set of equity trading strategies, we show that smoothing volatility targeting helps to regularise the extreme leverage/turnover that results from commonly used realised variance estimates. This has important implications for both the risk-adjusted returns and the mean-variance efficiency of volatility-managed portfolios, once transaction costs are factored in.

In frequentist settings, the parameters and return levels of the best fitted probabilistic model (i.e., generalized extreme value) are estimated using maximum likelihood and linear moments method. On the other side, under the Bayesian framework, the parameters and return levels are calculated both for non-informative and informative priors. This task is completed with the help of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method using the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. This study also highlights a procedure to build an informative prior through historical records of the underlying processes from other nearby weather stations. The findings attained from the Bayesian paradigm demonstrate that the posterior inference could be affected by the choice of past knowledge used for the construction of informative priors. Additionally, the best method for the modelling of extreme rainfall over the country is decided with the support of assessment measures. In general, the Bayesian paradigm linked with the informative priors offers an adequate estimations scheme in terms of accuracy as compared to frequentist methods, accounting for ambiguity in parameters and return levels. Hence, these findings are very helpful in adopting accurate flood protection measures and designing infrastructures over the country.","tags":null,"title":"A comprehensive study on the Bayesian modelling of extreme rainfall.
